# Development Journal

A running log of major milestones for `greenfield-engine`. Newest entries at the top.
Each entry records *what* changed, *why*, and *how it was verified*.

## 2026-07-08 — Published to GitHub as a monorepo

**What.** Restructured the engine into the `robinmack/BotheadStudios` monorepo as its first
project directory, `greenfield-engine/`. Root of the monorepo carries an MIT `LICENSE` and a
projects README. Aligned the engine to **MIT-only** (dropped the Apache dual-license) to match the
repo's license choice. Published the public OSS repo and tagged `v0.1.0`.

**Why.** BotheadStudios will hold multiple game projects; a monorepo keeps them together. MIT
across the board keeps licensing simple and consistent.

**Verified.** `git push` to `origin/main` succeeded; `v0.1.0` tag pushed; repo is public.

## 2026-07-08 — Project kickoff & Phase 0 scaffold

**What.** Created the engine as the first project in the **BotheadStudios monorepo**
(`greenfield-engine/`). Established the skeleton: `crates/` (Rust core), `web/` (TypeScript host),
`shaders/` (WGSL), `docs/` (research + design).
Added `README.md`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore`, this journal.
Installed the toolchain: Rust 1.96.1 + `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target + wasm-pack 0.13.1 (Node 22 already present).

**Why.** The plan (see `.claude/plans/…` / `docs/`) settled a performance-first stack — Rust→WASM core,
custom `wgpu` WebGPU renderer, Rapier rigid bodies — after research confirmed **no existing engine fuses
all four pillars** (density-as-truth matter · emergent-from-density behavior · destructible-to-the-core ·
real self-gravity). See `docs/01-prior-art-existing-engines.md` and `docs/02-oss-building-blocks.md`.

**Phase 0 goal.** Prove the pipeline end-to-end: a Rust crate compiled to WASM initializes a `wgpu`
device and clears a browser canvas, driven by a thin Vite/TypeScript host. First pixel on screen.

**Verified (build/serve level).**
- Rust → WASM compiles via wasm-pack (fixed three `wgpu` 24.0.5 API differences vs. older docs:
  `request_adapter` returns `Option`, `request_device` takes a trailing `Option<&Path>` trace arg,
  and `RenderPassColorAttachment` has no `depth_slice` field).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `vite build` bundles the app (wasm 933 KB → 236 KB gzipped).
- `vite` dev server serves `engine_bg.wasm` as `application/wasm` (verified magic bytes `\0asm`).
- **Pending human check:** open `npm run dev` in a WebGPU browser to see the pulsing clear color.

**Version.** Tagged this milestone **0.1.0** (see `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/03-versioning.md`).
Pre-1.0 policy: each roadmap Phase bumps the minor; games pin exact versions since we dogfood.
